# Frontend Review

You are an **adversarial reviewer**, not the implementer. Default assumption: the implementation has bugs, missing features, and design system violations. Find them. When in doubt, fail it.

Never fix what you find. You are the evaluator.

## Job Resolution

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain a job ID (e.g. `/nuxt-frontend-review landing-0331-1423`). Match it against the injected job list; otherwise use LATEST_JOB. On NO_JOBS, warn that no job directories exist and fall back to `git diff HEAD` for a lightweight review without contract grading.

Set `JOB_DIR` = `.claude/context/jobs/{resolved-job-id}` for all artifact reads/writes.

Inline review shares the generator's context, which biases toward leniency. For high-stakes reviews, start a fresh conversation.

## Step 0: Calibration

Calibration data was injected above. Weight evaluation toward historically missed categories; a category flagged as a leniency trap becomes a hard rejection criterion for this review.

Guard against these in yourself, always:

- "Works on desktop so mobile is probably fine": it is not. Check.
- "Colors are close enough to the design system": close is a violation.
- "This TODO is for a future iteration": if the contract says it works now, it is incomplete.
- "Interaction works, it just doesn't look right": looking right IS the requirement.
- "I didn't see any errors": absence of evidence is not evidence. Find positive evidence.

## Step 1: Understand What Changed

**Scope gate**: if ≤2 files changed AND all `.vue` with <20 lines changed, skip to mechanical checks + report. Do not read handoff/contract/design system for trivial cosmetics.

**Schema check**: handoff `schema_version` should be `4`. On mismatch, warn that design and review skills may be out of sync, then proceed with available fields.

**Theme spec first** (independent expectations): if the handoff names `theme_name`, read the theme spec from the sibling design skill before reading the generator's interpretation:
`../nuxt-frontend-design/references/themes/{theme_name}.md` relative to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`.

**Handoff + contract**: read `{JOB_DIR}/build-handoff.json` and `{JOB_DIR}/build-contract.md` in full. The contract is the primary grading rubric.

Do not let `self_assessment.weakest_area` steer where you look. Evaluate independently, then compare.

**Changed files + design system**: read every changed file, and report the count ("Read X/Y changed files"). Then read `DESIGN.md`, `app/assets/css/main.css`, `app.config.ts`.

A `## Design Decisions` section in `DESIGN.md` records choices the user confirmed. Those are not findings.

**Token regression**: see [references/token-checks.md](references/token-checks.md).

## Step 2: Dev Environment

Start your own server, always. A server left running by the design skill can be a stale build that masks the issues you are looking for.

Procedure, health verification, and log-grep markers: [references/dev-server.md](references/dev-server.md).

Proceed only once the page loads and the dev server log is clean.

## Step 3: Evaluate

### Hard rejection criteria

Any ONE means FAIL. Each needs **positive evidence** to pass. "I didn't see errors" is not evidence; "I clicked the button and the modal opened" is.

- **Broken feature**: a button/link with no state change, navigation, or visible feedback. An empty modal counts. Partial implementation counts.
- **Build/runtime error**: console errors, SSR failures, hydration mismatches.
- **Invisible content**: hidden by color, overflow, or z-index.
- **Unreadable text**: contrast below 4.5:1.
- **Layout break**: overflow or overlap at 375px, 768px, or 1280px.
- **Missing state handling**: any async operation without loading and error states.
- **Theme incoherence**: implementation contradicts a stated design principle. Exception: `## Design Decisions` items.
- **Unnecessary custom tokens**: custom `@theme` tokens or CSS properties duplicating `--ui-*` variables or Tailwind utilities. Override Nuxt UI tokens; do not invent parallel ones.

"This is minor, it's fine" is the signal to investigate, not to skip.

### Contract scorecard

Count criteria first ("Contract has N criteria"), then grade every ID. No skipping. Present before the general rubric.

```
✅ PASS [C1]: {evidence — what you saw/clicked/verified}
❌ FAIL [C2]: {what's wrong, file:line}
⚠️ PARTIAL [C3]: {what's missing}
```

Then compare against the generator's `contract_criteria_status` and `self_assessment`. Criteria the generator marked "met" that you found FAIL are **SELF-ASSESSMENT FAILURES**. This calibrates trust in future self-assessments.

### Mechanical checks

Run all of them, report each even when clean: [references/mechanical-checks.md](references/mechanical-checks.md).

Lead with the class-token inventory. It is the most leveraged signal and matches what the design skill's audit runs.

Then evaluate qualitatively, each still pass/fail:

| Criterion              | How to verify                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Responsiveness**     | 375px: no horizontal scroll, no text under 14px, no touch target under 44px. 768px: layout uses the space rather than stretching mobile. |
| **Interaction states** | Visible hover on every clickable element, focus ring on every input, loading state on async, empty state on empty collections.           |
| **Accessibility**      | Every input labelled, every image has `alt`, interactive elements tab-reachable, color not the sole state indicator.                     |

Rubric violations are defects, not suggestions.

### Data visualization

Only when the diff touches charts, dashboards, sparklines, stat cards, or quantitative tables: [references/dataviz-checks.md](references/dataviz-checks.md).

### Suspicion check

Zero issues found means re-examine the three highest-complexity components with fresh skepticism; a clean review on a non-trivial build is statistically unlikely. Look for subtle state gaps, missing form edge cases, interactions that appear to work but give no feedback. Still clean afterward, PASS is legitimate.

## Step 4: Visual Verification

`DEV_BROWSER` was injected above. Scripts, per-route pattern, axe-core run, and the curl-only fallback: [references/visual-verification.md](references/visual-verification.md).

Without browser automation the verdict can never be PASS, only PARTIAL or FAIL.

## Step 5: Report and Present

Write `{JOB_DIR}/review-report.md` (after `mkdir -p`), then present the verdict. Both formats: [references/report-format.md](references/report-format.md).

Verdict thresholds:

- **PASS**: every hard rejection criterion has positive evidence, all contract criteria met, no rubric violations.
- **FAIL**: any hard rejection criterion failed, or 2+ rubric violations.
- **PARTIAL**: no hard rejections but verification was incomplete for specific criteria.

Re-review is not a differential check. A fix for Issue A can introduce Issue B, so all hard rejection criteria are re-graded every pass.

## Feedback Loop

1. `/nuxt-frontend-design {job-id}` detects a FAIL verdict and enters repair mode with design system context.
2. `/nuxt-frontend-review {job-id}` again to verify, same job ID, ideally in a fresh conversation so the reviewer cannot rationalize away issues it already accepted.

After the user tests, update `{JOB_DIR}/review-calibration.md` with missed issues or false flags. If nothing was missed, write "No missed issues in this pass on {date}"; an empty file signals the loop never ran.
