# useRuntimeHook

> Registers a runtime hook in a Nuxt application and ensures it is properly disposed of when the scope is destroyed.

<important>

This composable is available in Nuxt v3.14+.

</important>

```ts [signature]
function useRuntimeHook<THookName extends keyof RuntimeNuxtHooks> (
  name: THookName,
  fn: RuntimeNuxtHooks[THookName] extends HookCallback ? RuntimeNuxtHooks[THookName] : never,
): void
```

## Usage

### Parameters

- `name`: The name of the runtime hook to register. You can see the full list of [runtime Nuxt hooks here](/docs/4.x/api/advanced/hooks#app-hooks-runtime).
- `fn`: The callback function to execute when the hook is triggered. The function signature varies based on the hook name.

### Returns

The composable doesn't return a value, but it automatically unregisters the hook when the component's scope is destroyed.

## Example

```vue [pages/index.vue]twoslash
<script setup lang="ts">
// Register a hook that runs every time a link is prefetched, but which will be
// automatically cleaned up (and not called again) when the component is unmounted
useRuntimeHook('link:prefetch', (link) => {
  console.log('Prefetching', link)
})
</script>
```
