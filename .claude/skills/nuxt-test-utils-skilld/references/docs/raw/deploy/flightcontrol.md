## Set Up your Flightcontrol account

On a high level, the steps you will need to follow to deploy a project for the first time are:

1. Create an account at Flightcontrol
2. Create an account at AWS (if you don't already have one)
3. Link your AWS account to the Flightcontrol
4. Authorize the Flightcontrol GitHub App to access your chosen repositories, public or private.
5. Create a Flightcontrol project with configuration via the Dashboard or with configuration via `flightcontrol.json`.

## Create a Project with Configuration via the Dashboard

1. Create a Flightcontrol project from the Dashboard. Select a repository for the source.
2. Select the `GUI` config type.
3. Select the Nuxt preset.
4. Select your preferred AWS server size.
5. Submit the new project form.

## Create a Project with Configuration via `flightcontrol.json`

1. Create a Flightcontrol project from your dashboard. Select a repository for the source.
2. Select the `flightcontrol.json` config type.
3. Add a new file at the root of your repository called `flightcontrol.json`. Here is an example configuration that creates an AWS fargate service for your app:

```json [flightcontrol.json]
{
  "$schema": "https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json",
  "environments": [
    {
      "id": "production",
      "name": "Production",
      "region": "us-west-2",
      "source": {
        "branch": "main"
      },
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "nitro",
          "buildType": "nixpacks",
          "name": "My Nitro site",
          "type": "fargate",
          "domain": "www.yourdomain.com",
          "outputDirectory": ".output",
          "startCommand": "node .output/server/index.mjs",
          "cpu": 0.25,
          "memory": 0.5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
