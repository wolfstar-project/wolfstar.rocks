# Introduction

> A structured logging library for TypeScript. Simple logging, wide events, and structured errors, from quick one-liners to comprehensive request-scoped events.

**evlog** is a structured logging library for TypeScript. It gives you simple one-liner logs, wide events that accumulate context over any operation, and structured errors that explain *why* something failed and *how* to fix it.

Inspired by Logging Sucks by Boris Tane.

## Philosophy

Traditional logging is broken. Your logs are scattered across dozens of files. Each request generates 10+ log lines. When something goes wrong, you're left grep-ing through noise hoping to find signal.

**evlog** takes a different approach:

Replace `console.log` with typed, structured events that flow through a drain pipeline.

</card>

<card icon="i-lucide-layers" title="Wide Events">

Accumulate context over any unit of work (a request, script, or job) and emit once.

</card>

<card icon="i-lucide-shield-alert" title="Structured Errors">

Errors that explain why they occurred and how to fix them.

Human-readable in development, machine-parseable JSON in production.

## Three Ways to Log

evlog provides three APIs for different contexts. You can use all three in the same project.

### Simple Logging

Fire-and-forget structured logs. Replace `console.log`, consola, or pino:

```typescript [src/index.ts]
import { log } from 'evlog'

log.info('auth', 'User logged in')
log.error({ action: 'payment', error: 'card_declined', userId: 42 })
```

### Wide Events

Accumulate context progressively over any operation, then emit a single comprehensive event:

<code-group>

```typescript [scripts/sync-job.ts]
import { createLogger } from 'evlog'

const log = createLogger({ jobId: 'sync-001', queue: 'emails' })
log.set({ batch: { size: 50, processed: 50 } })
log.emit()
```

```typescript [src/worker.ts]
import { createRequestLogger } from 'evlog'

const log = createRequestLogger({ method: 'POST', path: '/api/checkout' })
log.set({ user: { id: 1, plan: 'pro' } })
log.emit()
```

```typescript [server/api/checkout.post.ts]
import { useLogger } from 'evlog'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const log = useLogger(event)
  log.set({ user: { id: 1, plan: 'pro' } })
  return { success: true }
  // auto-emitted on response end
})
```

</code-group>

One log, all context. Everything you need to understand what happened.

### Structured Errors

Errors with actionable context: `why` it happened, how to `fix` it, and a `link` to docs:

<code-group>

```typescript [server/api/checkout.post.ts]
import { createError } from 'evlog'

throw createError({
  message: 'Payment failed',
  status: 402,
  why: 'Card declined by issuer (insufficient funds)',
  fix: 'Try a different payment method or contact your bank',
  link: 'https://docs.example.com/payments/declined',
})
```

```json [Response]
{
  "statusCode": 402,
  "message": "Payment failed",
  "data": {
    "why": "Card declined by issuer (insufficient funds)",
    "fix": "Try a different payment method or contact your bank",
    "link": "https://docs.example.com/payments/declined"
  }
}
```

</code-group>

## Why Context Matters

We're entering an era where AI agents build, debug, and maintain applications. These agents need **structured context** to work effectively:

- **why**: The root cause, so the agent understands what went wrong
- **fix**: An actionable solution the agent can suggest or apply
- **link**: Documentation for complex issues

Traditional `console.log` and generic `throw new Error()` provide no actionable context. evlog's structured output is designed for both humans and AI to parse and act on.
