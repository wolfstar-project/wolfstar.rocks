**Nuxt x Zerops Quickrun **

<br />

Want to test running Nuxt on Zerops without installing or setting up anything? Using repositories Zerops x Nuxt - Static or Zerops x Nuxt - SSR on Node.js you can deploy example Nuxt app with a single click.

</tip>

Zerops supports deploying both static and server-side rendered apps with a simple configuration file in your project root.

## Static

Projects and services can be added either through a Project add wizard or imported using a YAML structure:

### Creating a Project

```yml [zerops-project-import.yml]
project:
  name: recipe-nuxt

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: static
```

This will create a project called `recipe-nuxt` with a Zerops Static service called `app`.

### Setting up Zerops YAML

To tell Zerops how to build and run your app, add a `zerops.yml` to your root:

```yml [zerops.yml]
zerops:
  - setup: app
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - yarn
        - yarn nuxi generate
      deployFiles:
        - .output/public/~
    run:
      base: static
```

Now you can trigger the [build & deploy pipeline using the Zerops CLI](#building-deploying-your-app) or by connecting the app service with your GitHub / GitLab repository from inside the service detail.

## SSR Node.js

Projects and services can be added either through a Project add wizard or imported using a YAML structure:

```yml [zerops-project-import.yml]
project:
  name: recipe-nuxt

services:
  - hostname: app
    type: nodejs@20
```

This will create a project called `recipe-nuxt` with a Zerops Node.js service called `app`.

### Setting up Zerops YAML

To tell Zerops how to build and run your app, add a `zerops.yml` to your root:

```yml [zerops.yml]
zerops:
  - setup: nuxt
    build:
      base: nodejs@20
      buildCommands:
        - yarn
        - yarn build
      deployFiles:
        - .output/~
    run:
      base: nodejs@20
      ports:
        - port: 3000
          httpSupport: true
      start: node server/index.mjs
```

Now you can trigger the [build & deploy pipeline using the Zerops CLI](#building-deploying-your-app) or by connecting the app service with your GitHub / GitLab repository from inside the service detail.

## Building & Deploying your App

- Install the Zerops CLI.

```sh
npm i -g @zerops/zcli
```

- Open Settings > Access Token Management in the Zerops app and generate a new access token.
- Log in using your access token with the following command:

```sh
zcli login <token>
```

- Navigate to the root of your app (where `zerops.yml` is located) and run the following command to trigger the deploy:

```sh
zcli push
```

Your code can be deployed automatically on each commit or a new tag by connecting the service with your GitHub / GitLab repository. This connection can be set up in the service detail.
