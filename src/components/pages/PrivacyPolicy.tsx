					OUR LEGAL BASES FOR HANDLING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
				</Typography>
				<Typography component="div">
					The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal
					data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
				</Typography>
				<Typography component="div">
					<ul>
						<li>
							Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
							<br />
							Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
							(“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply,
							whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law.
						</li>
						<li>
							Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
							obligations thereof.
						</li>
						<li>Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject.</li>
						<li>
							Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
							in the Owner.
						</li>
						<li>Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.</li>
					</ul>
				</Typography>
				<Typography component="div">
					In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
					whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
					contract.
