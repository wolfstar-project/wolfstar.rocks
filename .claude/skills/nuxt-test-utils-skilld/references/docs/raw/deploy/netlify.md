# Netlify

> Deploy your Nuxt Application to Netlify infrastructure.

<tip>

**Zero Configuration **

<br />

Integration with Netlify is possible with zero configuration, learn more.

</tip>

## Setup

Nuxt will auto-detect that you are in a Netlify build environment and build an optimized version of your server.

For new sites, Netlify will detect that you are using Nuxt 3 and set the publish directory to `dist` and build command to `npm run build`.

<note>

If you are upgrading an existing site from Nuxt 2 you should check these and update them if needed.

</note>

If you want to add custom redirects, you can do so with [`routeRules`](/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering) or by adding a `_redirects` file to your `public` directory.

For deployment, just push to your git repository as you would normally do for Netlify.

Set the following environment variable to run Nuxt on Edge Functions:

```bash
SERVER_PRESET=netlify_edge
```

## On-demand Builders

On-demand Builders are serverless functions used to generate web content as needed that’s automatically cached on Netlify’s Edge CDN.

They enable you to build pages for your site when a user visits them for the first time and then cache them at the edge for subsequent visits until the next deployment.
