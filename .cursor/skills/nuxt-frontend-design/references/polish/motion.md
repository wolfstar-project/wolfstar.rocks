# Motion & Animation

Orchestrated motion that creates delight without overwhelming.

**Philosophy**: One well-choreographed page load with staggered reveals > scattered micro-interactions everywhere.

**Rule**: Springs over easing. Springs feel natural — they respond to physics, not arbitrary curves.

## Should This Animate At All?

Before picking easing or duration, decide whether the element animates at all. Frequency dictates the answer.

| How often users see it                                                              | Decision                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100+ times/day (command palette, keyboard shortcut targets, primary-action buttons) | No animation. Keyboard-triggered actions especially — animation makes repeated actions feel slow. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation, tab switches)                    | Minimal. ≤ 150ms or none.                                                                         |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts, dropdowns)                                     | Standard animation.                                                                               |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, empty states, celebrations)                          | Room for delight.                                                                                 |

Raycast's command palette has no open/close animation — that is correct for something used hundreds of times a day. If the only purpose of an animation is "it looks cool" and the user sees it often, delete it.

## When to Use What

| Technique                          | Use Case                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CSS `transition`                   | Hover, color, simple transforms, **anything rapidly re-triggerable** (toasts, toggles) — transitions retarget mid-animation |
| CSS `@keyframes`                   | Loading spinners, ambient loops, **one-shot** entrances where interruption doesn't matter — keyframes restart from zero     |
| `motion-v` / Motion library        | Entrance animations, scroll reveals, stagger, gestures with interruption                                                    |
| `mcp__motion__generate-css-spring` | CSS spring timing functions                                                                                                 |

**Interruptibility rule**: if the element can be triggered again before its animation finishes (adding a toast while one is still entering, rapid toggle flips), use a CSS transition, not a keyframe. Keyframes snap back to frame zero on re-trigger; transitions retarget from the current value.

## motion-v Setup (Nuxt)

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
	modules: ["motion-v/nuxt"],
});
```

---

## Page Load Choreography

The highest-impact animation pattern. Stagger children for orchestrated entrances:

```vue
<Motion
  :initial="{ opacity: 0 }"
  :animate="{ opacity: 1 }"
  :transition="{ staggerChildren: 0.08 }"
>
  <Motion
    v-for="item in items"
    :key="item.id"
    :initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }"
    :animate="{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }"
    :transition="{ duration: 0.5, ease: 'easeOut' }"
  >
    <ItemCard :item="item" />
  </Motion>
</Motion>
```

---

## Scroll Reveals

```vue
<Motion
	:initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }"
	:in-view="{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }"
	:transition="{ duration: 0.6, ease: 'easeOut' }"
>
  <UCard>Content revealed on scroll</UCard>
</Motion>
```

### Staggered Scroll Reveal

```vue
<Motion :in-view="{ transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 } }">
  <Motion
    v-for="feature in features"
    :key="feature.id"
    :initial="{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }"
    :in-view="{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }"
  >
    <FeatureCard :feature="feature" />
  </Motion>
</Motion>
```

## Spring Timing Guide

Use `mcp__motion__generate-css-spring` to generate:

| Feel     | Duration | Bounce  | Use Case                             |
| -------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Snappy   | 0.2s     | 0.1-0.2 | Buttons, toggles, micro-interactions |
| Normal   | 0.3-0.4s | 0.2-0.3 | Cards, modals, page elements         |
| Dramatic | 0.5-0.8s | 0.3-0.4 | Hero entrances, reveals              |
| Slow     | 1s+      | 0.1     | Background elements, ambient         |

---

## Page Transitions

```vue
<!-- app.vue -->
<NuxtPage>
  <template #default="{ Component }">
    <Motion
      :initial="{ opacity: 0, filter: 'blur(10px)' }"
      :animate="{ opacity: 1, filter: 'blur(0px)' }"
      :exit="{ opacity: 0, filter: 'blur(10px)' }"
      :transition="{ duration: 0.3 }"
    >
      <component :is="Component" />
    </Motion>
  </template>
</NuxtPage>
```

---

## Parallax (Hero sections)

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { scrollY } = useScroll();
</script>

<template>
	<div class="relative overflow-hidden">
		<!-- Background moves slower -->
		<Motion :style="{ y: scrollY * 0.3 }" class="absolute inset-0 bg-mesh" />
		<!-- Content stays normal -->
		<div class="relative z-10">
			<slot />
		</div>
	</div>
</template>
```

---

## Floating Elements

```vue
<Motion
	:animate="{ y: [0, -10, 0] }"
	:transition="{ duration: 4, repeat: Infinity, ease: 'easeInOut' }"
>
  <div class="decorative-orb" />
</Motion>
```

---

## PROHIBITED (when motion-v available)

- Raw `@keyframes` for entrance animations
- CSS `cubic-bezier` for spring-like effects
- Manual delay classes for stagger
- Inline timing approximations
- `transform: scale(0)` as an entry state — nothing in the physical world disappears to nothing. Start from `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0` so the entrance reads as a thing arriving, not a thing materialising.
- `ease-in` on any UI element (dropdowns, modals, popovers). It delays the first movement — the exact moment the user is watching most closely — so a 300ms `ease-in` dropdown feels slower than a 300ms `ease-out` one. Reserve `ease-in` for exits where you _want_ the element to hesitate briefly before leaving.

---

## Duration Rules

Timing matters more than easing. These are defaults — themes override them deliberately (a devtool's 80ms "snappy" and a zen theme's 500ms "contemplative" are both correct for their intent). Check the theme file's `Motion` line first.

| Duration  | Use Case            | Examples                           |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 100-150ms | Instant feedback    | Button press, toggle, color change |
| 200-300ms | State changes       | Menu open, tooltip, hover          |
| 300-500ms | Layout changes      | Accordion, modal, drawer           |
| 500-800ms | Entrance animations | Page load, hero reveals            |

Exit animations should be ~75% of entrance duration.

## Easing Without Springs

When CSS springs aren't available, use exponential curves — they mimic real physics:

```css
/* Quart out — smooth, refined (recommended default) */
--ease-out-quart: cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1);

/* Expo out — snappy, confident */
--ease-out-expo: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
```

**Default: avoid bounce and elastic curves.** For most UI they feel dated and amateurish. Real objects decelerate smoothly — they don't bounce when they stop. Overshoot draws attention to the animation instead of the content.

**Exception: tactile / playful themes.** If the theme's identity is physical (clay, kinetic-paper, teenage-engineering), bounce _is_ the voice — a clay button that doesn't spring is dead. Check the theme file's `Motion` line before applying this rule.

---

## Reduced Motion

Not optional. Vestibular disorders affect ~35% of adults over 40.

motion-v respects `prefers-reduced-motion` automatically for spatial animations via `<Motion>`. You still need a CSS fallback for any hand-rolled `@keyframes` or `transition` outside motion-v (hover colour shifts, spinners, CSS toggles):

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
	.card {
		animation: fade-in 200ms ease-out; /* Crossfade instead of motion */
	}
}
```

Preserve functional animations (progress bars, spinners, focus indicators) — just remove spatial movement.

## Perceived Performance

Nobody cares how fast your site is — just how fast it _feels_.

- **80ms threshold**: Our brains buffer input for ~80ms. Anything under feels instant. Target this for micro-interactions.
- **Preemptive start**: Begin transitions immediately while loading (skeleton UI). Users perceive work happening.
- **Optimistic UI**: Update immediately, handle failures gracefully. Use for low-stakes actions (likes, follows); avoid for payments or destructive operations.
- **Ease-in toward completion** makes tasks feel shorter (peak-end effect weights final moments).
- Too-fast responses can decrease perceived value — users may distrust instant results for complex operations.

---

## Performance

- Only animate `transform` and `opacity` — everything else causes layout recalculation
- For height animations (accordions), use `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` instead of animating `height`
- Don't use `will-change` preemptively — only when animation is imminent (`:hover`, `.animating`)
- For scroll-triggered animations, use motion-v's `in-view` with `{ once: true }` — it unobserves automatically after the first trigger
- Limit parallax layers to 2-3 max
- Cap total stagger time — 10 items at 50ms = 500ms max. For many items, reduce per-item delay
